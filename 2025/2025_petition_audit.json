Despite this overwhelming mandate, the University administration has failed to take meaningful steps toward divestment. This inaction ignores the findings of the International Court of Justice, which has recognized Israel’s responsibility for the crime of apartheid, as well as reports from the United Nations, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, which have documented Israel’s actions in Gaza as constituting genocide. As Israel intensifies its military operations in the West Bank and repeatedly violates ceasefires, we join the global call for accountability and sanctions.\n\nThis resolution designates the so-called Israeli Defense Forces (henceforth referred to as the Israeli Occupation Forces, or IOF) as a terrorist entity. The IOF poses a direct threat to our campus community. IOF soldiers have doxxed Stanford students, and at Columbia University, they used chemical weapons (skunk spray) against pro-Palestine protesters, resulting in hospitalizations. Additionally, former IOF soldiers at Columbia have actively campaigned for the deportation of student Mahmoud Khalil. This violence is not new; the IOF emerged from Zionist militias such as the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi, which terrorized Palestinian and other Arab communities long before 1948. After 1948, the IOF conducted covert operations in Arab nations to intimidate local Jewish populations into supporting the Zionist settler-colonial project. Today, we witness the IOF perpetrating a livestreamed genocide and intentionally starving the people of Gaza.\n\nThis resolution amplifies the call for political bodies to sanction Israel, as is already being done to varying degrees by nations worldwide. It also urges campus affiliates in decision-making roles to protect our community from individuals implicated in war crimes. For example, applicants or speakers who served in the IOF beyond the legally mandated conscription period should undergo additional scrutiny to ensure they are not complicit in atrocities. These measures can be modeled, in part, on the Hind Rajab Foundation, which seeks justice for Hind Rajab and all victims of Israel’s genocidal campaign by holding IOF perpetrators accountable in international and domestic courts.\n\nWe call on the University to honor the student mandate, uphold its commitment to people's rights, and take immediate action to sanction those complicit in these atrocities. The time for accountability is now.","user":"briansl","signees":["briansl","brlum708","bsalt","cmuang","cmvan","ericktrs","marcoc02","msoul","nolaye94","pjasmine","pnsahoo","tula8","vpaez"]},{"id":518,"topic":"ugs","slug":"milane","title":"Antonio Milane for Senate","content":"Dear All,\n\nMy name is Antonio Milane!

As a student body committed to justice, sustainability, and ethical responsibility, we must confront this exploitative industry and advocate for meaningful change. This petition calls for increased awareness, institutional support for transitioning away from animal agriculture, and the integration of animal liberation into our campus’s sustainability framework.\n1. The Oppression of Animals:\nAnimals raised in industrial agriculture endure unimaginable suffering, confined to inhumane conditions and denied their most basic freedoms. Their resistance to this oppression, as seen in documented cases of animals fleeing slaughterhouses, underscores their inherent desire for life and autonomy. We cannot ignore their plight.\nReference: Cows’ Struggle for Freedom\n2. Climate Impact:\nAnimal agriculture is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and biodiversity loss. Research shows that a rapid global phaseout of animal agriculture could significantly mitigate climate change, highlighting the urgent need for systemic transformation.\nReference: PLOS Climate Study\n3. Exploitation of Vulnerable Workers:\nThe industry relies heavily on marginalized populations, including incarcerated individuals, undocumented workers, refugees, and people of color, who face dangerous working conditions, physical and psychological harm, and systemic exploitation. These workers are often treated as disposable, with little regard for their well-being.\nReferences:\n• ALDF Report on Worker and Animal Exploitation\n• Human Rights Watch Report on Worker Rights\n\n\nOur Demands:\nIn light of these injustices, we call on the student government and university administration to take the following actions:\n1. Public Awareness Campaigns:\n  • Issue a formal statement to the student body and local news outlets acknowledging the interconnected harms of animal agriculture, including animal oppression, climate impact, and worker exploitation.\n  • Display educational materials in dining halls highlighting the ethical, environmental, and social consequences of industrial animal agriculture.\n2. Support for Transitioning Away from Animal Agriculture:\n  • Provide resources and support for students seeking to adopt plant-based diets.\n  • Ensure that all dining facilities offer equally attractive, nutritious, and accessible vegan alternatives wherever there are animal products.\n  • Maintain ongoing dialogue with students to improve the quality and variety of plant-based options.\n3. Integration into Sustainability Frameworks:\n  • Incorporate animal liberation and the quantification of animal exploitation into existing sustainability frameworks and decision-making processes.\n  • Include the ethical and environmental impacts of animal agriculture in cost-benefit analyses and food procurement policies.\n\n\nConclusion:\nBy taking these steps, our university can demonstrate leadership in addressing the interconnected crises of animal oppression, climate change, and social injustice. Together, we can build a more ethical, sustainable, and compassionate food system that aligns with our values of justice and equity.\n\nWe, the undersigned students, call on the student government to recognize this petition as a referendum of student sentiment and to work collaboratively with students, faculty, and administration to implement these changes.","user":"briansl","signees":["anyanels","briansl","cpandey","mliu1785","naochien","sceva","sofiv192","vpaez"]},{"id":381,"topic":"ugs","slug":"votesong","title":"For a bigger bang for your buck, vote Hoyoon Song!","content":"Hello everyone!\nMy name is Hoyoon Song, and I am running to be one of your 15 senators!

I'm running again for Senate to continue defending DEI, ensuring equitable funding, and delivering real resources for our communities facing challenges. Sign my petition today to help keep this momentum going.\n\nFor the past quarter, I’ve led a team of seven Senators reviewing $8 million in Annual Grant requests from 200+ student groups. We made tough choices, working with a budget of $4.5 million while prioritizing equity and financial responsibility. Amidst all this, I've balanced preparing for my Truman Scholarship interview, surviving ECON 102B, and keeping up as a student.\n\nServing as Appropriations Chair isn’t easy—every funding decision carries weight. And when executive orders threaten DEI and marginalized students, we need leaders who fight back—in policy and in practice.\n\n“A week ago, I wondered: Should I rerun for Senate? Does this work matter? Then, I got my answer.”\n\n\nFinancial Officers from the Muslim Student Union (MSU) joined my Office Hours seeking funds for their Ramadan Iftar Dinners in their Joint Annual Grant. Although we couldn't fully fund their request, I fought to ensure they had enough support for this vital community tradition. Working closely with MSU and the Graduate Student Council, we found a fair and fiscally responsible solution.\n\nDays later, as I walked to work at the FLI Student Success Center, I saw a canopy being built in Old Union. I wondered what it was for.\n\nThe following week, I passed by again—this time, I saw Stanford’s Muslim community gathered, breaking their fast, sharing a meal, and celebrating their faith with joy.\n\n“That’s when it hit me: This work matters. I have to keep going.”\n\n\nOur communities deserve someone who will fight for them—not just in the fancy rooms where decisions are made, but in the real world, where those decisions turn into impact.\n\nOne More Time.\nAs your Undergraduate Senator, I will continue to fight for a stronger, more equitable Stanford—one that defends DEI, secures critical funding for student organizations, and fights for those most vulnerable to national political attacks.\n\nTo continue this fight, I need your help. Sign my petition today to put me on the ballot and keep pushing for an equitable, inclusive Stanford.\n\n📌 Read my complete platform here: bit.ly/platform-sengthay\n🌐 Learn more on my website: bit.ly/SengthayforSenate\n\nThank you for your support.

My eyes lost focus; medically speaking I might have refractive errors. On the same day, I took three final exams — nine hours in total. \nThis past quarter I enrolled in two math and physics courses to fulfill my major requirements. However, all three of them fall into one single day. Not just I, people in my class who had similar issues talked with their instructors and none were willing to accommodate. That is why I am petitioning for  a change in our final exam scheduling process that grants students rights to reschedule their final exams if they exceed 6 hours or two consecutive exams in a single day. \nWhy should we do so? Researchers at Des Moines University have shown that students performed worse in back-to-back exams with only a 15-minute break than those in spaced-out exams (research paper here). A 15-minute break between exams is exactly what I had. This is scientifically proven to be an effective method to assess students’ academic ability. Moreover, this does not even account for the fact that some candidates have to walk to the other side of the campus.  I could not even get lunch between my first and second exams. It is preposterous that we do not even have a chance to eat, when we are supposed to be supported in taking the exams.  [Figure 1: Stanford Winter Final Exam Schedule]\nI am proposing The \"Bunching\" Rule, which has been implemented across different college campuses in the United States. Bowdoin College, a liberal arts college in Maine rules that “students with three or more final exams in two consecutive days may reschedule one for a day mutually agreeable to the student and the instructor.” In the University of Colorado, Boulder, they have a similar policy that “When students have three or more final examinations on the same day, they are entitled to arrange an alternative examination time for the last exam or exams scheduled on that day.” University at Buffalo in New York even defines a final exam conflict as “Three or more final exams scheduled on the same day.” Makes sense! The Wake Forest College Faculty in North Carolina already established a policy back in 2010 that “Students should have no more than two exams in a 24-hour period.  They should be allowed to reschedule exams in excess of two in a 24-hour period.” In University of Nebraska-Lincoln, they have a policy that mandates faculty to accommodate students, “The instructor(s) of the third and subsequent final examination is (are) then obligated to provide an alternative final examination time during Final Exam Week.” \nIt makes sense to let students rest and perform to their best ability rather than stressing out and intensely working for 9 hours and possibly longer for those who have classes starting at 4:30 any day (that adds up to 12 hours straight testing). How can we expect students to sit in the classroom and head down for 12 hours for the heaviest weighted exam in the quarter? \n\n[Figure 2: Bowdoin Fall 2024 Exam Rotation has two hours gap between each exam]\nAs such, we are petitioning that the university implement the following changes: \n1. Students should not have more than two final exams scheduled on the same day. \n2. For the two exams, there should be at least 1 hour apart during non-lunch hours; at least 1 hour and 30 minutes during lunch hours; all the 15 minute gap should not be tolerated. \n3. The faculty must ensure that the final exams are in line with the physical and mental well-being of candidates. Students should be able to reschedule the test on a day of the final week that they do not have two or more exams. \n4. All conflicted final exams should be rescheduled without permission.\n\nIf you experienced similar scheduling issues and want to share your voice, fill out this Google form for testimony.

I went to an under-resourced rural high school where opportunities weren’t just handed to us—we had to create them. I saw the gaps firsthand: the lack of funding, the absence of cultural representation, and the limited resources for students like me. But instead of accepting it, I worked to change it. I organized Culture Day to celebrate diversity, created student-led initiatives and organizations to bring more resources and opportunities to my peers. I know what it’s like to feel unheard, to see problems and wonder if anyone is going to step up. And I know the power of taking action, of creating change instead of waiting for it. That’s why I’m running for Senate. I love the feeling of making a difference—of turning ideas into real improvements that help people. At Stanford, I see the same need for advocacy, student support, and real change. I want to take the same passion that drove me in high school and use it to make Stanford a place where every student feels supported, valued, and heard.\n\nMY EXPERIENCES:\n\nGender Equity : Through Stanford Women in Politics, I organized programming events that uplift women’s voices in policy and governance.\nDEI \u0026 Cultural Support : Through the SAPling program, I am proposing a bill to support cultural houses and pre-professional orgs, ensuring they are well supported.\nFLI Advocacy : As a THRIVE participant, I understand firsthand the importance of mentorship and institutional support for FLI students . \nLeadership : At Girls Nation, as one of 2/450 California representatives, I debated policy and gained hands-on legislative experience.\nCivic Dialogue : I serve on the Advisory Board for Unify America, bridging political divides and fostering meaningful discussions nationwide.\nEnvironmental Advocacy : I led a 503c nonprofit, the Junior Philanthropists Organization, organizing lobbying efforts \u0026 training 200+ youth advocates for environmental policy change.\nLegislative Experience : As a legislative intern for the California Assembly, I worked on education policy and student rights, gaining first hand experience in government.\n\nAll of these experiences have shaped my ability to collaborate, advocate, and lead. Whether it’s fighting for FLI students, protecting cultural spaces, or bridging political divides, I know how to work with others to make meaningful change—and I’m ready to bring that same dedication to the ASSU Senate.\nMore information about me \u0026 my platform here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xNXJJmg7PZbFPWoZ5QwTtKikreAftLl-s4YsIdY0PeQ/edit?usp=sharing \n\nMY PLATFORM:\n\n\n1. Expand Themed Housing Options\n• Establish a South Asian House and/or a Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) House to provide a supportive community for students from different backgrounds, fostering discussions on history, identity, and shared experiences.\n• Strengthen existing cultural-themed housing, such as Casa Zapata and Ujamaa\n\n\n2. Protecting Mental Health Initiatives\n• Strengthen funding and institutional support for The Bridge Peer Counseling Center to ensure round-the-clock access to mental health resources. \n• Push for increased mental health service availability\n• Advocate for reduced wait times for CAPS appointments.\n\n\n3. Advocating for FLI Initiatives\n• As a THRIVER, I am committed to protecting FLI initiatives, ensuring the new pre-orientation program's success.\n• Work toward re-expanding THRIVE \u0026 SOAR, providing more students with opportunities to access mentorship, community, and support. \n\n\n4. Campus Safety\n• Increased campus lighting in poorly lit areas to improve nighttime safety. \n• Expand and improve 5-SURE hours to ensure students have safe, reliable late-night transportation.\n\n\n5. International Student Support\n• Push for a more organized international student orientation with more communication\n• International peer mentorship program through the Bechtel Center.\n• Push for more cultural events and integration programs that allow international students to connect \n\n\nAs your ASSU Senator, I will fight to strengthen mental health resources, protect FLI initiatives, expand cultural housing, and support international students—because every Cardinal deserves a campus that uplifts them! So VOTE Laila Ali for Senate, lets make change together \u003c3\n\n- Laila Ali\nClass of 2028","user":"lailaali","signees":["emtan","josie25","clc2028","stanley3","ahbracey","srome","rmabdull","alopez0","ciraulo","gabefm","edvardls","turnervs","celestev","arbab","akengin","nailah","judestj","raveno","skilic","giransom","owebster","gab777","mrazmjoo","cpierre","wdt","mcorteza","sofiamar","ninac","handrews","gkhatch","khawaja","heidia74","anna28","lihelena","evanyi","parasher","skumar8","marchdt","malaikan","bochoa2","noorelk","dayanara","lucyp","imeyer28","zmahamad","gyang08","myra5","ealfonso","ivypchen","gracejxq","yoanna1","orishaba","mathbs","pkeep","glallen","adriagar","petermcg","abdel6","aaira","surayan","mkrim","janamadi","pujaadh","zuireth1","ojmartin","nat16san","lily06","liemandt","diyak31","sache","sharish","nnarey","arahmlow","nkemobi","misbah28","rhaque","madsj","rosentha","mnahalea","gcedillo","rivdowdy","tobychau","hhamid","ania28","skxran","melodyw0","rishijey","viviansm","aliasajj","sofiagz","ellaslan","oromeroc","ariffin","sa0204","yazanalf","owen222","ellawen","kailamae","supriya1","angelali","jenin","kshao24","nnoelle","wamonte","natalia5","almarya","imonnoo","byagana","jennybal","jucabreu","breebora","kfareed","ntkim","isabrazd","tungdn","vrxiao","asadg","anhthu28","jasony13","sulegl32","alexis17","asiachen","toluwani","qdd","husna963","lh03","edgarguz","megluong","ctoh28","merrilla","jkarlson","kisemben","kenzyd","kaythiam","gaustinb","kenza","emuller","arimwill","hscar","intisar","pochweri","vasuag","sarasami","ihsaan","dalakour","knprice","sidh","a727","sdesai28","jennesp","lmadadi","aparkhe","alexiap","yameens","ghalyah4","ashadan"]},{"id":744,"topic":"petition","slug":"banchikn","title":"ban chik'n, refund dining swipes","content":"Ban \"chik'n\" at every dining hall and have R\u0026DE refund unused meal plan swipes.","user":"ericktrs","signees":["aeuche","aili","ajadhav","alexisli","aleyang","allybush","ammas","andbui","andman","benjiw","cld1005","davfox","eachung","ebrowne","echen598","ellaheh","eriche26","ericktrs","gabbymel","gmw","hansi","hmunoz","huiying2","idalmas","ilecher","ilee05","jalmeida","javokhir","jcorso","jeli","jghazal","jromovz","jstnyang","judestj","kaiblank","kaitwang","kkant","kxniu","lgravina","liamfay","lonuoha","marcorp","mark28","mnasra","monteroe","msoul","mutiti","naochien","nickrui","nolaye94","nsk1","ochiang","pjasmine","rcbecker","rdubi","reillym","rithvik","roanh","rubistha","ryansb","samih","sanaya","sdesai05","sufiyanj","suhhyeon","tentara","vfish","vivianzh","yameens","yuhanw28"]},{"id":646,"topic":"ugs","slug":"emmaforsenate","title":"Emma Muller for ASSU Senate!","content":"Hi!

As Social Chair, I have been instrumental in bringing new and exciting graduate student activities (like our Night at TopGolf, outings to sports and arts events, etc.) as well as helping maintain our traditional events like Grad Formal. I came into the GSC when we had to rebuild our social life post-campus closure and now, I co-run events that continuously sell out and serve 1000+ graduate students every year. Beyond being social chair, I also am a first-generation-to-college Latina student and am extremely passionate about affordability issues, immigration and diversity advocacy, and educational accessibility.

But what if we had a system that actually reflected the diversity of our class? Under the current ASSU By-Laws, the role of class presidents is vague, giving them unchecked power over decision-making. They can even appoint their own cabinet members without requiring elections, consolidating leadership into a small, exclusive group. This system isn’t built for transparency or representation—it’s built for maintaining the status quo.\n\nWe’re proposing a petition to replace class presidents with an 18-member council, starting with the Class of 2029 and beyond. It’s not completely representative of us all, but it’s still better than the existing system. No changes would affect current classes’ structures, but future classes would have a leadership team that brings in more voices, more perspectives, and more representation. A Council means less power concentrated in just a group of friends and more collaboration to tackle issues that matter to all of us. \n\nIf you want a leadership system that truly represents the student body, sign the petition and help make this happen! Stanford thrives on diversity—so why doesn’t our class leadership reflect that?\n\nHere’s our referendum for more details.

I served on the GSC last year as an at-large representative and co-chair. I'm running again for a term as a School of Engineering or at-large representative.\n\nLast year, I worked with university leaders and offices on wide-ranging issues, including: lowering the cost of reserving space for student groups; clarification of various free speech policies and potential changes to the campus disruption policy; preserving institutions with great importance to students on campus, including the Bridge Peer Counseling Center and the annual Thanksgiving dinner for graduate student and their families; developing a common framework and set of guidelines for the many PhD rotational programs on campus; return of evening and late-night transportation options; improvements to campus infrastructure; increasing support for undocumented and international students; and many others.\n\nRecognizing that many of our collective efforts are yet to bear fruit and require continuous fighting and advocacy, I would like to continue working on the above and other issues related to transportation, housing, affordability, and international as well as undocumented student concerns.\n\nI advocate for a holistic approach to all modes of transportation that considers people walking, biking, driving, using mobility devices, public transit, and many others. I would like to continue working with students, staff, and faculty across campus on improvements to pathways, roads, and public transit. These could include separating bicycle and pedestrian traffic in conflict-prone areas, repaving low-quality segments of road, connecting disjoint pieces of bike paths and sidewalks, relocating obstructed bus stops, adding rain shelters, adjusting bus schedules to align with post-Covid commute times, extending Marguerite service hours to late nights and weekends, and exploring new service patterns.\n\nI would like to help in making low-carbon-footprint modes of transportation like biking and public transit more affordable. Initiatives that could help with this include providing free helmets and bike lights, providing cheap and secure bike storage like bike rooms, bike lockers, and bike cages, subsidizing public transit passes (in addition to the GoPass program already available for off-campus grad students), and funding complementary services like airport shuttles. I would also like to help continue GSC's successful free bike repair events.\n\nAs an international student, I am also passionate about issues affecting students who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. These include expanding informational resources and aid to students who don't (yet) have a specific legal concern or court case, addressing student concerns about the responsiveness and help received from the Bechtel Center, expanding and standardizing internship opportunities via Curricular Practical Training (CPT) for F-1 visa holders, as well as working to make part-time on- and off-campus employment during the academic year possible for more students.\n\nI would like to see R\u0026DE expand programs that can bring more affordable housing options to students, like the EVGR triples program, as well as subsidized off-campus housing that provides affordable apartments that are also located close to off-campus amenities like grocery stores, cafés, transit, etc. I would like LBRE to make the new MPS (mail and package) fee optional for students who don't wish to receive packages to their residence and guarantee that receiving USPS flat mail will continue to be perpetually available for free in any residence.\n\nI aim to work with Stanford and the Graduate Workers union to provide equal opportunities for students who are determined to be outside of the bargaining unit as well as to make sure that any issues that are determined to be of an academic nature and hence not covered by the collective bargaining agreement are still addressed by Stanford administration.","user":"arpl","signees":["andyyin","avilesl","bhaktia","briansl","epert","erpark","esoroka","lluqueno","rodwyer"]},{"id":1020,"topic":"ugs","slug":"arya","title":"For Us, By Us | Arya Shadan","content":"For Us, By Us.

Through live performances, speaker series, games and trivia, and collaborative events, the Rough Draft will act as a gathering space focused on intentional and social programming, fostering meaningful connections among students, faculty, and a breadth of campus organizations. \n\nThe Rough Draft will bridge student groups by curating events aligned with shared interests, enriching the Stanford community fabric. This cross-campus engagement will enhance student collaboration, strengthen social bonds, and contribute to a more vibrant campus community. Additionally, the Rough Draft will provide staffers with education in culinary arts, hospitality, operations, and financial management, equipping students with practical leadership skills in a real-world entrepreneurial setting. Through teamwork and structured class mentorship, the Rough Draft will not only serve as a social and cultural hub but also as a training ground for future leaders. \nInitially conceptualized as a student-run pub, the Rough Draught Pub proved to be a transformative addition to Stanford’s campus life through its successful pop-up events in Fall 2024. These gatherings demonstrated the high demand for a consistent, inclusive, and vibrant social hub for Stanford students.

I believe in noticing what’s overlooked, listening to what matters, and acting on what’s possible.\n\nHere are a few key changes I want to push for:\n✨ Free Tampons \u0026 Pads Everywhere ✨ – Some buildings provide free menstrual products, but many dorms, STEM, and older buildings still charge for them. That’s unfair and inconsistent. I will push to unify access and remove these hidden costs.\n\n✨ Implementing Wellness Days ✨ – the quarter system is unforgiving, and we need a break sometime. I will advocate for official Wellness Days — built-in, no-strings-attached days off — so students can recharge without falling behind.\n\n✨ Eco-Box Meals To-Go ✨ – Many campuses already have reusable to-go meal containers, but Stanford doesn’t. If you have back-to-back classes and no time for the dining hall, you should have the option to check out an Eco-Box, fill it with food, and eat on the go. This reduces waste and improves dining accessibility—a simple fix for a common problem.\n\n✨ Dorm Open House ✨ – Was I the only one lost filling out the housing application? I propose an event where all students can tour different housing options, ask residents questions, and make informed choices about where they want to live next year.\n\n✨ More Late-Night Options: Dining, Transportation, and Gym ✨ –  Let's stop gatekeeping buildings (I'm looking at you CoDa, Y2E2, Gates). Whether you're studying late, coming back from an event, or just need a (healthy) meal past 9 PM, you shouldn’t have to struggle. \n✨ Increased Study Spaces \u0026 Library Hours ✨ – Finding a quiet study spot or a group space shouldn’t feel like a competition. I will advocate for more 24/7 study areas, better reservation systems for group spaces, and dedicated silent-study zones that actually stay silent.\n\n✨ Reducing Light Pollution ✨ – I like stars, but light pollution is consuming them (nights are actually becoming around 10% lighter each year).

I am hoping to re-run for Senate next year! Introducing myself a little bit, I am a junior who is serving on the current 26th UGS Senate. I’m a double major in Comparative Studies in Race \u0026 Ethnicity as well as Political Science. I am also a proud daughter of Peruvian immigrants and from indigenous Quechua-Aymara family!  \n\nUsing key principles of accessibility, transparency, and visibility, I have used my position as a Senator to connect with and help advocate for the student body. I currently serve as Chair of the Housing \u0026 Dining Committee as well as being Deputy Chair of Affordability \u0026 Accessibility Committee and Health \u0026 Safety Committee. I also participated as a member of the Political Action Committee. During my time on the Senate, I have worked and participated towards campus-wide events and concerns, such as advocating for better support systems for co-ops including better RA stipends and having International Women’s Day programming. I have pushed for protections of our immigrant population at Stanford, including international and undocumented students. I hope to continue working with student groups and the student population to help advocate and advance their initiatives, concerns, and needs.\n\nNext year, I hope to continue these goals and work towards bigger and better changes for our campus life, including accessibility, safety, inclusivity, and general well- being of student life. \n\nPlease consider reading a little bit more about my experiences and platform here!  \n\nThanks!! \nViviana 🫶🏽","user":"avc26","signees":["afajardo","anunez7","bior","chris11","danny06","dianamcc","ematias","eshultz","fonsecaj","ginelle","giseller","glallen","hmunoz","hujason","ivypchen","jennesp","jessipr","jurogdy","lh03","lhilal","naima","sengthay","yduartep","yoanna1"]},{"id":1041,"topic":"ag_petition","slug":"asha_for_education","title":"Fund Asha for Education","content":"The administration just DENIED the majority of Asha Stanford's annual grant — a decision that will directly prevent 150+ students in India from attending school this year. Every $1000 Asha Stanford donates funds a student’s life (including education, housing, food, \u0026 other necessities) for an entire year.\n\nFor over three decades, Asha Stanford has been a cornerstone of Stanford's commitment to global education. We are a completely volunteer-driven organization of Stanford students and Bay Area community members who raise $100,000-250,000 annually through cultural philanthropy events, primarily through our signature Holi festival. Our Holi festival is legendary - what started with 300 people on campus has blown up to 10,000+ attendees, raising between $100-250K every year. That money goes directly to schools in India giving kids access to education they'd never get otherwise.\n\nOur current financial situation was misunderstood, and therefore, our annual grant was slashed from $34,000 to $11,000. Running Holi — an event completely free for all Stanford students — poses a significant cost to Asha. Without the annual grant, we will *not* be able to run Holi this year, neither will we be able to raise $100,000+ to donate to Indian non-profits. This actively abandons the hundreds of students we’ve been supporting for years.\n\nWe urge you to sign this petition asking the grant committee to reconsider their decision. Don't let bureaucratic ignorance DESTROY Stanford Holi — the event you love — and steal the future from underprivileged students who deserve better.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the critical expenses
